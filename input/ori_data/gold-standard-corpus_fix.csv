Furthermore it was discovered that a Janus family of tyrosine kinase (JAK) inhibitor AG490 inhibit the growth of human U87 and U251 glioma cells and AG490 enhanced the ability of Serenoa repens to inhibit the growth of U87 and U251 glioma cells as measured by the 3-(45-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-25-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. ,Negative

These results indicate that Serenoa repens reduces the growth causes apoptosis of Glioma cells and inhibits STAT 3 signaling. ,Treatment_of_disease

A randomized controlled clinical trial of Ocimum sanctum and chlorhexidine mouthwash on dental plaque and gingival inflammation. ,Negative
OBJECTIVE: In the present study we assessed the effectiveness of Ocimum sanctum on dental plaque  gingival inflammation and comparison with gold standard chlorhexidine and normal saline (placebo). ,Negative
OBJECTIVE: In the present study we assessed the effectiveness of Ocimum sanctum on dental plaque gingival inflammation and comparison with gold standard chlorhexidine and normal saline (placebo). ,Negative
RESULTS: Our result showed that Ocimum sanctum mouthrinse is equally effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis as Chlorhexidine. ,Treatment_of_disease
RESULTS: Our result showed that Ocimum sanctum mouthrinse is equally effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis as Chlorhexidine. ,Treatment_of_disease
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicate that Ocimum sanctum mouthrinse may prove to be an effective mouthwash owing to its ability in decreasing periodontal indices by reducing plaque accumulation gingival inflammation and bleeding. ,Treatment_of_disease

Although considerable evidence implicates cannabis use as a component cause of schizophrenia  it remains unclear whether this is entirely due to cannabis directly raising risk of psychosis or whether the same genes that increases psychosis risk may also increase risk of cannabis use. ,Cause_of_disease

In a sample of 2082 healthy individuals we show an association between an individual's burden of schizophrenia risk alleles and use of cannabis . ,Association
Although directly predicting only a small amount of the variance in cannabis use these findings suggest that part of the association between schizophrenia and cannabis is due to a shared genetic aetiology. ,Negative
